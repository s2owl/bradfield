I'm from the Steel City of Sheffield.  I'm interested in most things geeky.  I come from a Switching and Routing background, moving on to WiFi, before moving on to Secure Networks. I have a 2.1 BSc (Hons) degree in Networks and Communications.

Away from technology I'm a big fan of: my family, the Everly Pregnant Brothers, Feline Tattoo, mountain biking and Sheffield Wednesday.
